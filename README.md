  This is a Python project I'm doing out of curiosity and fun since I've always like the old roguelike games with ASCII graphics, this specific project is the first one that I feel confident enough to say that it's an actual serious project, and since I haven't seen anything like a roguelike made in Python without the help of libraries with built-in graphics I decided to do it myself, and of course, with the help of the AlphaBet community server on discord as well as some ideas from my girlfriend, many thanks to all of them!
